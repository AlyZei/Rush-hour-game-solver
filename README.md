# Rush-hour-game-solver
This repository was meant as a Rush Hour game solver. 

In Java, we first designed classes to define the game and its parameters.
We then tried solving the game with a straight forward algorithm of graph search. 
Our last step consisted of trying out different heuristics and comparing the game resolution times for each algorithm. 

Classes used for game parameters definition can be found in the folder "RushHourClasses".
Classes for heuristics definition can be found in the folder "Heuristics".
Classes for solving game states can be found in the folder "GameSolvers".

Further details about classes and our project are explained in the pdf file titled "INF421".

All files were written in collaboration with Celine Hajjar.
